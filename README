We live, we love, we grow New Orleans

NOLAdex is simply a digital rolodex, a collection of the many talented people of Greater New Orleans.
Here are some ways we think you'd love to use it:
find people like you to hangout with
hire talent
connect digitally to others by creating your own profile
This project was created by the generous volunteers who participated in the second day 'Hack Day' of [BarCampNola4](http://www.barcampnola.org) on the weekend of July 16-17, 2011. This site is further maintained by [gnocode](http://www.gnocode.com).
