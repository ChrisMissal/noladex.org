We live, we love, we grow New Orleans!
======================================

NOLAdex is simply a digital rolodex, a collection of the many talented people of Greater New Orleans.
Here are some ways we think you'd love to use it:
	* find people like you to hangout with
	* hire talent connect digitally to others by creating your own profile

This project was created by the generous volunteers who participated in the second day 'Hack Day' of [BarCampNola4](http://www.barcampnola.org) on the weekend of July 16-17, 2011. This site is further maintained by [gnocode](http://www.gnocode.com).

Development
===========
Just follow these steps to get started on submitting pull requests!

  * Fork this repo
  * create a noladex gemset in [rvm](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
  * run "bundle install"
  * run "rake db:setup"
  * run "rails server" and double check everything is working for you.
  * run "rake db:test:prepare" to setup the test database
  * in a separate terminal window, run "guard" to setup the testing suite
  * Change and submit a pull request back to us!  Also, please try to have a corresponding test to accompany whatever change you make if you can.  Otherwise we have to do it, and that makes us sad :(

Also, there are folks at Ruby Bayou every Tuesday at 7pm who are also probably hacking around on this.  Feel free to come by and join if you'd like to help but aren't sure where / how to start!
